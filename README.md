# Security-Incident-Automation-with-Wazuh-Shuffle-and-TheHive

## Objective
Through this project, an insecure Windows 10 agent is configured to notify Wazuh about security threats. Wazuh sends these alerts to Shuffle, who then forwards them to TheHive after processing them. An analyst is then notified via email by TheHive. After reviewing the incident, the analyst instructs TheHive on how to respond appropriately.

### Skills Learned
Threat Detection - Using Wazuh to identify and analyze security threats.
Automated Response - Leveraging Shuffle to streamline incident response.
Incident Management - Managing and documenting incidents in TheHive.
Decision-Making - Interpreting alerts and directing responses in TheHive.
Tool Integration - Integrating Wazuh, Shuffle, and TheHive into a cohesive system.

### Tools Used
Wazuh - For security monitoring and alerting.
Shuffle - For automating and orchestrating security workflows.
Windows 10 Hypervisor - A vulnerable system used to generate security alerts.
TheHive - For incident management and response.
