# Security-Incident-Automation-with-Wazuh-Shuffle-and-TheHive
Through this project, an insecure Windows 10 agent is configured to notify Wazuh about security threats. Wazuh sends these alerts to Shuffle, who then forwards them to TheHive after processing them. An analyst is then notified via email by TheHive. After reviewing the incident, the analyst instructs TheHive on how to respond appropriately.
